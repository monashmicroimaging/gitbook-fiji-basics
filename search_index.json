INTRODUCTION TO FIJI \nFIJI \nFIJI stands for \"Fiji Is Just ImageJ\". FIJI and ImageJ are very similar and for most functions are interchangeable. Both are open source image analysis software packages, available to download for free. The main difference between FIJI and ImageJ is that FIJI comes pre-bundled with a number of useful plugins which would require separate download and installation in ImageJ. FIJI also has an auto-update function that ImageJ does not have, and for advanced users is more user firendly and compatible for Macro writting. Our workshops focus specifically on FIJI, rather than ImageJ. As such, some things may differ if you are using ImageJ.\nDownloading FIJI \nFIJI downloads for PC and Mac can be found here: https://fiji.sc/\nUpdates \nFIJI has a built in auto-update function which will run, as required, upon opening the program. To allow the updater to run, select Yes, please from the drop down menu and click OK.\n\nFIJI will then automatically search for updates to the program and pluguin packages.\n\nAvailable updates will be displayed in a list. You can highlight specific updates you want to apply, but it is recommended that you apply all updates every time. To do this simply click Apply Changes at the bottom of the updater box, without selecting anything from the list.\n\nFIJI will then run through the list and apply all updates.\n\nOnce the updates have been installed you will be asked to restart the program. Select OK, then close and close and restart FIJI.\n\nNote: It is recommend that you always run the updater when it pops up. Extended periods without running the updater may result in FIJI no longer functioning correctly.\nYou can also run a manual update in FIJI. Select Help -> Update. FIJI will then run through the same update steps as above. Again, you will need to restart FIJI once this process is completed.\n\nManaging Update Sites\nSpecific sites can be included (ie: to use a specific plugin, you may need to add their website to updates) or removed (ie: a site from a plugin you no longer use and have uninstalled) from your updates . To do this select Manage Update Sites from the Updater Window when it appears.\n\nThis will open a list of all available websites assoaciated with ImageJ/FIJI and their plugins.\n\nSelect the site you want to change by ticking the checkbox next to the name, then click Add Update Site to include updates from this website in the current and all furute updates, or Remove to stop using this site for updates.\n\nSelect Close when you have finished managing your update sites then continue with your FIJI update as above.\nImageJ/FIJI Online Documentation and Tutorials\nAlso under this Help menu, you can find a link to the ImageJ Website which has helpful information on ImageJ/FIJI. For documentation on specific funcitons of ImageJ/Fiji, follow the links on this website to Documentation then ImageJ Documentation Wiki. Useful documentation can also be found at https://imagej.net/Category:Tutorials.\n"},"part_2_basic_navigation_in_fiji.html":{"url":"part_2_basic_navigation_in_fiji.html","title":"PART 2: BASIC NAVIGATION IN FIJI","keywords":"","body":"PART 2: BASIC NAVIGATION IN FIJI \nThe FIJI interface has many menus and options. In this section we will go through the basics for navigating the FIJI interface and opening and working with your images in the FIJI software.\nThe image Interstitium 2.tiff will be used for demonstration throughout this section.\nThe FIJI Interface \nThe FIJI interface opens as a small rectangular window on your screen, containing 8 menu options and a series of buttons, which will be referred to here as the tool bar. An information bar below the tool bar will display details of the tools or image when you hover over them with the cursor.\n\nOpening Files \nTo open files in FIJI go to File -> Open (or use shortcut Ctrl+O). Navigate to your folder and select the file you want to open.\n\nYou can also open files by dragging and dropping the file from your folder into the FIJI interface.\nIf you already have a file open in FIJI you can move on the next file in the series using the “Open Next” function. Go to File -> Open Next (or use shortcut Ctrl+Shift+O) and FIJI will automatically close the current file and replace it with the next file in the folder.\n\nImage Information Display \nSome basic image information can be found in the top left corner of your opened image. This display tells you the image name, dimensions (in pixels if scale has not been calibrated or microns if calibrated), image type and file size.\n\nDetailed Image Information \nYou can find more detailed image information by going to Image -> Show Info (or use shortcut Ctrl + I).\n\nThis will display information about the image based off the attached metadata. The more detailed the metadata, the more information you will get. For example, a raw format file such as .oif will have more information than a .tiff file. In turn a .tiff file will usually have more information than a .jpg file.\n\nZooming and Panning \nSelect the magnifying glass from the tool bar on the FIJI interface to activate the Zoom Tool.\n\nOnce the zoom tool is active you can easily zoom in and out using the mouse buttons. Left click to zoom in on the image, right click to zoom out. The position of the cursor on the image will determine the zoom centre.\nOther zoom options are available under Image -> Zoom.\n\nWhen you are zoomed in on an image you will not be able to see the entire image in the window. To move the image you can use the Scrolling Tool, also known as the Pan or Hand Tool. To switch to pan mode, select the hand tool from the tool bar on the FIJI interface.\n\nWith this tool selected, click and drag with the left mouse button to move to different areas in the zoomed image. An overview window will be displayed in the top left corner of your image, showing your location within the original image.\n\nDuplicate Image \nFIJI will often apply changes to the image as you work and some of these changes are irreversible. Therefore it can be useful to work with a copy of your image so that the original remains unchanged.\nTo create a duplicate image to Image -> Duplicate (or use shortcut Ctrl+Shift+D).\n\nAlternatively, you can right click on the image and select Duplicate from the menu.\n\nYou can give the duplicated image a new name or use the default (original image name –x), then select OK.\n\nA duplicate image will then be displayed alongside the original.\n\nNote: When duplicating an image that has an ROI selected only the selected part of the image will be duplicated. This can be a useful tool for cropping part of an image.\nSynchronise Windows \nIf you have multiple images or windows open that all require the same processing you can easily link the windows. This allows you to perform a single action that will be applied to all images.\nGo to Analyze -> Tools -> Synchronize Windows.\n\nIn the resulting window you can select which functions you want to synchronize and select specific images to synchronize from the list of all open images. Or you can synchronize all open windows by clicking on Synchronize All at the bottom.\n\nWhen synchronized, the images will be highlighted in the list (as shown above - blue highlighted image names) and the cursor will display as a red cross visible in both the active image and the synchronized image(s).\n\nAny movements or changes you apply to the active image will now automatically transfer to the synchronized image(s) as well. For example; scrolling through a z-series when synchronized will ensure that all images remain on the same focal plane. Or a region of interest drawn in the active image will also be displayed in the synchronized image(s).\n\nWhen you have completed your tasks and no longer want to apply your changes to all images, select Unsynchronize All from the options box and images will no longer be linked.\nRegions of Interest \nRegions of interest (or ROIs) are used to select a smaller area of an image for functions such as cropping or for analysis on that specific section. To create a region of interest choose one of the tools from the tool bar and select your area on the image.\n\nThere are 7 selection tools in total; 5 simple shape/line tools and the angle and point tools. The boxes which have small red arrows indicate that several options are available in this tool category. Right click on these boxes to display the options and select from the list.\n\nSimple Tools\n  Rectangle or Rounded Rectangle tool – Creates a rectangular ROI. Hold shift when selecting the area of interest to constrain to a square.\n Oval or Elliptical tool – Creates a circular ROI. Select freely for oval or elliptical shape, hold down shift during area selection to constrain to a circle.\n Polygon Selection tool – Define your own ROI shape by clicking around your area of interest to generate line segments. Double click, or click within the small box at the first point, to complete the shape.\n Freehand Selection tool – Click and drag with the mouse to draw your ROI of choice.\n Line tools – Select which type of line you want from the drop down list and click and drag to add straight, freehand or arrowhead lines of interest on your image. Al of these are created by clicking and ragging with the mouse. Select Segmented line from the options then click along multiple points in the image to create a segmented line. The line tool also has an option when you double click on the button to set the width of the line (in pixels).\n\nThe co-ordinates and size of any ROI will be displayed in the information bar when drawing, moving or resizing the ROI.\n\nAngle Tool\n Select the Angle Tool from the tool bar.\nClick on three points of interest in the image to measure the angle between them.\n\nThe angle will be displayed in the information bar as you are making the selection.\n\nOr go to Analyze -> Measure (or use shortcut Ctrl+M) to display the angle in a results window.\n\n\nPoint or Multi-Point Tools\nSelect Point  or Multi-Point  from the tool bar (to switch: right click point tool icon on the tool bar to choose from the drop down menu).\nUse this tool to select a single point or multiple points in your image for analysis. This tool is particularly useful for counting.\nYou can double click the point tool box to bring up options for points, such as type, size and labelling of points. For single points, options like adding to ROI manager or automatic measurement of points are also available.\n\nTo add multiple points in your image without using ROI manager hold ‘Shift’ and select each point or use the multi-point tool. However, these will not be measured individually during analysis and essentially become a single ROI (more details on multiple selection and ROI manager are given below).\nDeleting, Changing and Combining ROIs \nROIs can be modified in a number of ways after selection. This means you can undo a mistake by deleting, resizing or altering the ROI.\nTo delete an ROI click on the image outside of the ROI selection.\nTo resize an ROI click and drag on any of the small white boxes around the ROI border.\n\nWhen resizing ROIs you can control the movements in several ways:\n\n‘Shift’ + click & drag – will resize the ROI symmetrically\n\n‘Ctrl’ + click & drag – free resize the ROI around the centre\n\n‘Alt’ + click & drag – resize the ROI with constrained aspect ratio\n\n‘Alt’ + arrow keys – enlarge the ROI in any direction 1 pixel at a time\n\nPolygon ROIs will only move at the selected point to create a new shape, they will not resize in the current shape. Holding 'Shift\" and clicking a point, splits it into 2 points. Holding 'Alt' and clicking a point eliminates that point from the polygon.\n\nFreehand ROIs can not be resized, There are no points to click on within the ROI outline. Freehand ROIs  must be redrawn to change the shape or size.\n\n\nTo move any ROI left click inside the ROI selection and drag and drop to the new location. You can move the ROI more precisely using the arrow keys on the keyboard.\nYou can draw multiple ROIs by holding ‘Shift’ and drawing a second ROI of any type. However, as noted for multiple points, this is more like a merge ROIs function, as the two essentially become a single ROI and are not measured separately during analysis. This can be easily observed by drawing your second ROI overlapping an existing ROI. Once drawn the ROIs will merge into a single new shape. When using ‘Shift’ to add multiple ROIs this principle remains even for ROIs in separate parts of the image.\n\nTo select multiple ROIs for individual measurements you must use the ROI manager as described in the next section.\nHolding ‘Shift’ when adding/merging the second ROI will create a symmetrical ROI. To avoid this, hold ‘Shift’ to initiate the second ROI then release it and drag the new ROI to the desired shape.\nNote: If you click and drag a point within a \"merged\" ROI, such as that shown above, only that point will move, it will not resize the ROI in its current shape. The merged ROI essentially behaves as a polygon ROI.\nYou can also remove part of an ROI by holding ‘Alt’ and drawing a second ROI of any type overlapping an existing ROI. For example; hold ‘Alt’ and draw a second circular ROI inside an existing circular ROI to create a donut shaped ROI.\n\nNote: Once this second ROI is drawn neither ROI can be resized, and as the inside of the second ROI is no longer considered a selection you must click and drag within the space between the original and second ROIs to move it. If you click 'inside' the second ROI, your selection will be lost.\nBrush Tool\nROIs can also be added or modified using the Selection Brush Tool, which is found under the options for oval/elliptical ROIs in the tool bar. Right Click on the icon to select the brush tool from the drop down menu.\n\nAfter selecting the tool you can double click on the Selection Brush Tool icon in the tool bar to change the pixel size of the 'brush'.\n\nYou can then use the Selection Brush Tool to paint on an ROI.\n\nYou can also add or delete regions of an existing ROI. To add a region to an existing ROI, start from the inside of the ROI and sweep outwards over the area you want to incorporate.\n\nTo subtract from an existing ROI, start outside the ROI and sweep the brush inwards.\n\nROI Manager \nTo measure multiple ROIs individually, rather than a single 'merged' ROI measurement, you must add them to the ROI manager. To find the ROI manager go to Analyze -> Tools -> ROI manager.\n\nThis opens the ROI Manager window.\n\nSelect your ROI tool and make your selection on the image, then click Add in the ROI Manager (or use the shortcut: t). This will add the co-ordinates of the ROI to the list in ROI Manager.\n\nContinue drawing and adding all ROIs required. To add multiple ROIs of identicle shape and size, once the first ROI has been added to the Manager, you can then move the original ROI to a new location and click Add again. repeat this process for all ROIs needed.\nOnly the most recent ROI will be active, and visible, in the image, but all ROIs are saved within the image. To view all ROIs, tick the box next to Show All in the ROI manager. Also ensure the box next to Labels is selected so that the ROIs on the image will be numbered according to their position in the list.\n\nOnce you have selected and added all ROIs of interest to the list, select Measure from the ROI manager options to view results. Further options, such as saving the ROI list, are displayed by clicking More in the ROI manager.\n\nClick on a set of co-ordinates in the list to highlight an individual ROI. The co-ordinates in the list will be highlighted blue and ROI will display in the imge (or show as the active ROI if 'Show All' is selected).\n\nYou can then make individual adjustments to this ROI from the ROI manager options (delete, rename, etc) or measure it independantly by clicking measure while it is highlighted. Click Deselect to return to the full list.\nOverlay ROIs to a New Image \nWhen you have an ROI list in the manager, you can easily transfer this to a new image. Open the new image, then go to Image -> Overlay -> From ROI Manager.\n\nAll ROIs in the ROI manager will be duplicated on the second image.\n\nNote: These ROIs in the second image can't be resized or moved and will act as a 'merged' ROI in that only a single measurment for all ROIs combined will be given.\nIf you want to measure the ROIs in the new image individually that is still possible. Click on the new image to make it the active image then select one of the ROIs in the ROI Manager.\n\nThis ROI will now appear in the new image and you can click Measure in the ROI manager to get an individual measurement. Repeat for all ROIs.\nOverlaying Images \nYou can also use the overlay tools to combine images. Here we have used an example of adding a cropped section the original image as an overlay.\nOpen your second image or draw an ROI and duplicate part of the original.\n\nIf you want to keep the ROI on your image as an outline, do not click outside the selection in the original image. Do click the title bar to make it the active image again. To keep the ROI as an outline of the area used in the overlay, go to Image -> Overlay -> Add Selection (or use shortcut Ctrl+B).\n\nTo add the second image as an overlay to the original, ensure the original image is still the active window then go to Image -> Overlay -> Add Image.\n\nFrom the resulting window, select the image you want to overlay from the drop down list. You can also choose the overlay position. The co-ordinates (x and y location) for overlay position are given in pixels. Co- ordinates at 0,0 will place the image at the top left corner of the original.\n\nSelect OK to insert the picture.\n\nAt this point you can still undo the overlay by going to Image -> Overlay -> Remove Overlay. To create a permanent image with the overlays go to Image -> Overlay -> Flatten. This creates a new image with the overlays irreversibly embedded.\n\nAdding Text to Images \nAdding text to images can be useful for labelling and incorporating image information.\nSelect the Text Tool from the tool bar, then click and drag on the image to create a text box and begin typing.\n\n\n\nYou can alter the font, size and colour by opening the text options. You can also add a background colour to the text box to allow better conrast between the text and the image. Double click on the Text Tool to open the Fonts options window. Text options can be modified either before or after typing your text and the changes will be applied.\n\nYou can move the text after adding it to the image by clicking and dragging inside the text box, similar to moving an ROI. Do not click outside the text box as this will delete the text. To keep the text on the image go to Image -> Overlay -> Add Selection (or use shortcut Ctrl+B).\n\nYou can then work with the text as you would any other overlay (show/hide/remove) and select flatten to create a new image with text completely incorporated into the image. If you are working with a stack, this option will only add the text to the first image in the series.\nYou can also go to Edit -> Draw (or shortcut Ctrl+D) to incorporate text into the image, but this will keep text only. If you have a background colour this will be lost with this option, so ensure your text colour is clearly visible. When working with stacks this option will allow you to apply the text to all images in the stack.\n\nSaving; Formats, Options and Image Quality \nTo save changes go to File -> Save (or use shortcut Ctrl+S). This will overwrite the previous file and save any changes. If it is a new image the default save format is TIFF (as imagename.tif).\n\nTo choose a specific format for saving, got to File -> Save As, and select the format you want to use for the image from the list. Select your folder and name your file as you normally would. Commonly used file formats include: TIFF, JPEG, AVI, PNG, EPS, PDF.\n\nUnique, but Useful, File Formats\n\nImage Sequence: saves each image from a stack as an individual TIFF file. You can select numbered images or use slice labels for naming.\n\nSelection: saves ROI(s) for re-use at a later time\n\nXY Co-ordinates: saves ROI(s) as a text list of x and y co-ordinates\n\n\nSaving Measurements\nUse Save Results from the file options to export all data in an active results window as a text file.\nOr; to export results as an Excel file, click on the results window and within the window select File -> Save As.\n\nSelect your folder and name the file as you normally would and select the file tye (.csv, .xls, etc) from the drop down menu. Click Save to export the results file.\n\nAn Important Note on Image Quality and Compression\nFar too often people save their data directly from the microscope as a JPEG file. The JPEG file format seems good in theory, as the file sizes are smaller and it save space on your hard drives. But JPEG is what we call a ‘Lossy’ format. When you save as a JPEG your images are compressed – this is achieved by REMOVING PIXELS FROM THE IMAGE DATA.\nThis image information that is lost with JPEG compression can NEVER be restored. Even if you resave with a different level of compression or in a different file format the loss is irreversible. The more you open, edit and re-save a JPEG, the more information is lost.\nTo maintain the quality of your images and the integrity of your resulting data, ALWAYS save your original data in the raw format (ie: .oif for Olympus, .nd2 for Nikon, .lif for Leica, etc) and keep the original raw file untouched. Save your working copies as TIFF files to avoid compression and loss of image quality and data. Only save as JPEG for the final version to be submitted to journals or used in presentations AND KEEP THE ORIGINAL AND THE TIFF as well for any further editing that may be required.\nIf your original data is requested by a journal, which is happening more frequently these days – sending them JPEGS will not be acceptable.\nTo maintain quality and integrity of your data, remember these points when working with and saving your files:\n\nAlways save from the microscope in the raw file format and keep that copy untouched\nKeep an unedited backup – duplicate your image and make the changes on that as some edits are irreversible, save and keep both copies as TIFFs\nLoss of pixels = unreliable measurements\nSave working copies as TIFF files to avoid continual compression\nOnly go to JPEG at the very end for a final ‘submission’ copy of the image\n\n"},"part_3_bio-formats_importer.html":{"url":"part_3_bio-formats_importer.html","title":"PART 3: BIO-FORMATS IMPORTER","keywords":"","body":"PART 3: BIO-FORMATS IMPORTER \nImages saved in raw file format from microscope software packages are unique to that software and often will not open in standard image viewing software. However, these formats can be easily opened in FIJI using the Bio-Formats Importer. This is a pre-bundled plugin in FIJI but it must be downloaded separately for ImageJ. It is also known as LOCI tools, this is the plugin name for ImageJ.\nExamples of the different file types discussed in this section (Leica, Olympus, Nikon, DeltaVision, Zeiss) can be found in the Bio-Formats folder of demonstration images.\nConfiguration \nYou can check the file types enabled in the Bio-Formats importer, as well as turn specific formats on and off and change preferences by opening the configuration settings. To do this go to Plugins -> Bio-Formats -> Bio-Formats Plugin Configurations.\n\nThis opens a configuration window. Select the Formats tab from the top to display and modify the available programs and equipment.\n\nSelect your file format from the list to check it is enabled and see compatible extensions.\n\nSelecting the Windowless box will open these file formats without first opening the import options window. This speeds up opening but means you cannot change import settings on individual images and all images will open with the default settings (or those previously set by you when opening files with Bio-Formats). You can come back to configurations and reverse this if you need to change import options at another time.\nOpening with Bio-Formats \nYou can import files by going to Plugins -> Bio-Formats -> Bio-Formats Importer.\n\nWith the Bio-Formats plugin installed, you can also open most compatible file types by going to File -> Open and selecting your file, or dragging and dropping onto the FIJI interface as you would any other image file.\nDuring the opening process for all file formats the Import Options window will open, unless you have previously set ‘windowless’ opening for that file type under configurations. In the options window you can change the settings for metadata, separating channels, z-planes or time points into single image windows and colour options.\n\nWhen you have selected all options you want, click OK to open the image.\nThese different options and variations in opening files with the Bio-Formats Importer are discussed below followed by how these variations apply to common file formats.\nMetadata \nTo view the in-built image information, known as metadata, select the box next to Display Metadata in the options window of bio-formats importer. Then click OK to open both the image and metadata.\n\nMetadata will be displayed in a separate window to the image as a list. Here you will find information including things like bitdepth, channel information, acquisition parameters and scale.\n\nChannel and Colour Options \nSometimes colours can’t be assigned correctly from the metadata or you may want to assign specific colours to your image. You can do this in Bio-Formats Importer by selecting Custom from the drop down menu under Colour Mode.\n\nIn the resulting Bio-Formats Custom Colourization window you can set the RGB colour values for each of the channels. Once you are happy press OK. The file will open with the assigned colours.\n\nSplit Channels/Focal Planes/Time Points \nSelecting the boxes next to split channels, focal planes or time points will result in each plane opening as in individual image, rather than a stack or hyperstack.\nThis can be useful if you want to extract a single z-plane or time point from a series, or only want to display one channel from your image. All images will open, but you can easily close the ones you don’t need.\nSpecific planes, channels or time points can also be extracted when working with stacks (discussed in section 8), but in some circumstances, opening separately can be a quicker or easier option to use.\nOpening Image Series \nSome files will contain multiple image stacks or experiments within one file. These can be opened separately through bio-formats importer.\nWhen opening files with multiple experiments, a second window will be displayed after the opening options. This second window displays all of the experiments in a list.\n\nTick the box next to the one you want to open and press OK. Ticking multiple boxes on will open multiple datasets, but doing this could put strain on the FIJI program memory and cause a crash.\nImages will open using the options selected in the initial opening window.\nDifferent Data Sets (Olympus, Leica, Nikon, DeltaVision, Zeiss) \nIn general, the file will be displayed as you have selected during the opening process. However, there are a few variations in opening using bio-formats depending on the file. The common file formats are discussed below.\nLeica (*.lif files): The saving format for Leica files means they will always contain multiple data sets in the single file. Follow the steps for opening image series as above.\nOlympus (*.oif files): The channel information from Olympus files cannot be read correctly when opening these files in FIJI. You can open the file as normal and reassign LUTs (explained in section 6) or you can choose custom colour and assign colours to channels as you open, as described above.\nNikon (.nd or .nd2 files): Nikon files usually open without any special requirements. Some Nikon files may contain multiple datasets and require image sequence opening method to be used.\nDeltaVision (*.dv files): Files from DeltaVision will open without special requirements, but open in grey scale and will need to be false coloured if required.\nZeiss (.czi or .lsm files): Zeiss files will open as a hyperstack directly without any dialog box being shown.\n"},"part_4_scales_and_sizing.html":{"url":"part_4_scales_and_sizing.html","title":"PART 4: SCALES AND SIZING","keywords":"","body":"PART 4: SCALES AND SIZING \nFor proper presentation of images it is essential to include a scale bar. This allows the viewer to see the scale of the image being presented and make their own conclusions about the data. Calibrating an image is also important if you want to get meaningful size-related measurements out of the image in any later analysis. Calibration is also important when resizing your images. In this section we will show you how to find calibration information from the image, and how to set the scale if the image is not calibrated. We will also demonstrate how to add a scale bar and how to crop and resize images without altering the image data.\nThis section uses the images Interstitium 2.tif and TrichromeIHC.tif for demonstration.\nFinding Scale Information in the Image Properties \nIn some circumstances FIJI will be able to calibrate your image automatically by reading the attached metadata. This is usually the case for images originally saved in the raw file format.\nIf the scale is already calibrated the dimensions shown on the image will be in microns instead of pixels.\n\nIn a calibrated image you can find the scale in microns/pixel by going to Image -> Properties (or use shortcut Ctrl+Shift+P).\n\nThis will open a display window showing the dimensions of the image and the scale will be automatically populated at the correct size.\nFor this image we see the scale is automatically set at 2.2microns/pixel.\n\nYou do no need to make any changes here, select OK or close the window to exit.\nYou can also find the calibrated scale, this time in pixels/micron, by going to Analyze -> Set Scale.\n\nHere you will also find the dimensions correctly populated from the metadata if your image was already calibrated.\n\nUnder Set Scale the calibration (pixels/micron) is the inverse of that shown under image properties (microns/pixel).\nYou do no need to make any changes here, select OK or close the window to exit.\nFinding Scale Information in Metadata \nWhen opening a file using bio-formats importer you can also find the calibration in the metadata, although this can sometimes be hard to find within the long list of parameters.\nTo find the calibration in the metadata, ensure Display Metadata is selected in the bio-formats options as previously described.\n\nThe scale information can look different in the metadata of one file compared to another. How it is listed will be dependent on the file type. In this example, if we scroll downt he metadata, we come to the units, listed as microns, and below that, the scale shown as X and Y resolutions of 0.454545. So this gives us the scale of 0.454545 pixels per micron.\n\nAs shown previously you can also find information from the metadata by going to Image -> Show Info (or shortcut Ctrl + I). This is useful if you dont need bio-formats importer to open your image.\n\nYou will find the scale information listed here if it was in the image metadata. Again, how it is listed may varry with file type.\n\nNote: Usually if the scale is listed in the metadata, FIJI will scale the images automatically upon opening. If your image is not scaled, you most likely won't find this information in the metadata either.\nSetting the Scale Manually \nFor a non-calibrated image, the dimensions of the image will appear in pixels in the top corner of the image.\n\nIf you know the conversion factor, you can set the scale manually by inputting the conversion into either the image properties or set scale windows.\nTo input the scale via Image Properties go to Image -> Properties (or shortcut Ctrl+Shift+P), as previously described.\n\nIn an uncalibrated image the pixel dimensions will all be displayed as 1. Change the unit of length from pixels to microns and enter the conversion factor in microns (ie: 1 pixel = x microns). For the example used here, the calibration in microns/pixel is 0.45.\n\nSelect OK to save the calibration changes, then save the image to maintain the calibration permanently.\nIf preferred, you can also input the calibration in pixels/micron via the Set Scale tool. To do this, go to Analyze -> Set Scale, as previously described.\n\nThe pixel aspect ratio in the Set Scale window will be displayed as 1. To enter the scale, change the unit from pixels to microns and enter either the distance in pixels (2.22222... for this example) or in microns (0.45 for this example).\n\nSelect OK to save the scale, and save the image.\nWhichever method you chose, you will now have a calibrated image that you can easily add a scale bar too, or make accurate measurements on.\n\nAdding Scale Bars \nTo add a scale bar to your calibrated image, select the image and go to Analyze -> Tools -> Scale Bar.\n\nIn the resulting window, enter you scale bar preferences.\nUnder width enter the size you’d like the scale bar to represent.\nEnter your Font size and select Colour and Location for the scale bar from the drop down menus.\nTo show the scale bar line only without dimensions labelled underneath it, check the box next to Hide text.\n\nHere we have set a scale bar of 100microns, in black at the lower right corner of the image. You will see a preview of the scale bar on the image as you make changes.\n\nWhen you are happy with the appearence of your scale bar, select OK and save the image to save the scale bar.\n\nIf you want your scale bar in a very precise location within your image, you can draw a line ROI in that location on your image then follow the steps to addthe scale bar. In the options window it will add a scale bar the same length as the ROI, you can over-ride this and enter any length you want. The location will show \"At Selection\".\n\nmake any other changes you want and again, select OK and save the image to insert and save the scale bar.\nCropping Images \nIt is always reccommended that you keep your original image unaltered and create a duplicate for cropping. You can easily take care of duplication and cropping on one step by drawing an ROI in your original image and duplicating the section.\nSelect your ROI tool, as previously described, and draw a region of interest around the area you want to crop.\n\nRight click in the selection and choose Duplicate from the drop down menu.\n\nIn the Duplication window you can give the image a new name or keep the default.\n\nClick OK to create the duplicate as a new image.\n\nTo crop an already duplicated image, or without duplicating, select your ROI tool and draw an ROI as above. Then go to Image -> Crop (or use shortcut Ctrl+Shift+X).\n\nThis will crop the active image to the selected ROI without any duplication.\n\nResizing or Scaling Images \nYou can resize, or scale, your image using several different methods. All of these methods resize your image by scaling the pixels. While size changes can be undone (until you hit save) it is still recommended you work with a duplicate image when making any changes to pixel information and always leave your original data unchanged.\nBecause these methods alter the pixel information within the image they should not be used prior to any measurements being made on an image.\nThe first method is the Image Size tool, which is found under Image -> Adjust -> Size.\n\nThis will open the Resize options window, where you can enter the new image size in pixels. You can also select to Constrain Aspect Ratio for the image and the Interpolaiton. We have set the new size for our image as 512 by 512 pixels and we have removed averaging and set interpolation to None.\n\nSelect OK to apply the changes to the image. Note not only the difference in size here but also the difference in the pixel dimensions following the image resizing.\n\nThe next method for changing image size is the Scale tool, which is found under Image -> Scale (or use shortcut Ctrl+E).\n\nIn the Scale window, enter the vale by which you want to scale your image (ie: scale factor of 2 will double the image size, scale factor of 0.5 will halve the image size). The aspect ratio will automatically be constrained, when you change the scale factor for X, the Y scale factor will adjust accordingly. The height and width (in pixels) will also automatically adjust according to the scale factor entered.\nSelect settings you require for the Interpolaiton and Averaging.\nThe biggest benefit to using Scale as your method of resizing is that you can select Create new window so changes will be made to a duplicate image, not the original. This means that you can skip duplicating the original before scaling and the original will always remain unchanged. You can give the new image a different name or keep the default.\nHere we have used a scale factor of 0.5 to half the image size and selected no interpolation or averaging. This gives us essentially identical settings to those used using the Image Size tool above.\n\nClick OK to apply the changes to the image. A duplicated image, at the new size, will be created alongside the original image. Again notice both the change in image size and the change in pixel dimmensions int he new image.\n\nThe third method is Binning, which is found under Image -> Transform -> Bin.\n\nBinning reduces an image by pixels similar to the other methods. The disadvantage of using binning is that it can only reduce image size, you can't scale up (ie: create an enlargment, etc). When using Re-sizing or Scaling you can increase or decrease image size. The main benefit of using Binning as your resizing method is that it is supported by the Undo command and therefore changes can be reversed. Binning is usually recommended more for reducing file size than changing image dimmensions for display/presentation purposes.\nIn the Options, enter the Shrink Factor or how much you want to reduce the image. For example 2 x 2 binning will rduce the image size by half. Select your method from the Bin Method drop down menu. Here we have used Averaging.\n\nClick OK to apply the changes to the image. Again be aware of the change in pixel dimmensions of the image as well as size appearence.\n\nThe final method is Scale to DPI, which is found under Image -> Adjust -> Scale to DPI.\n\nUnder Scale to DPI you can enter a final image resolution size in dots per inch (or DPI) and the image will be scaled accordingly. Enter your final required DPI in the first box and select the Interpolation method from the drop down menu and choose whether to average or not. Select the check boxe next to Create new window. You can give the resized image a new name if preferred. here we have again halved the image size by scaling froom 600 DPI to 300 DPI, and chose no interpolation and no averaging.\n\nClick OK to create the new image. A new window will be created with the re-sized image. As always note teh difference in appearance and pixel dimmensions in the new image.\n\nA benefit to using Scale to DPi to resize, along with the create new window option, is that you can also resize by entering a size in inched into the options and maintain the DPI. For example here we leave the DPI at 600, but enter size values of 1 inch by 1 inch. Again select your choices for Interpolation and Averaging and select Create new window.\n\nIn the new image now you will see a slightly different size to the previously resized images and teh dimmensions are now displayed as 1in x 1in. new pixel dimmensions can also be found in brackets beside the new dimmensions (here: 600 x 600).\n\nNote: The size entered here is the display size of the image, that is; as a panel in a larger image at 600DPI this picture would be 1 inch wide by 1 inch long. The sizes used here are not related to the pixel/micron scale of the image.\n"},"part_5_channels_and_colours.html":{"url":"part_5_channels_and_colours.html","title":"PART 5: CHANNELS AND COLOURS","keywords":"","body":"PART 5: CHANNELS AND COLOURS \nImmunofluorescence experiments are almost always captured on highly sensitive monochrome cameras. This means that each fluorophore is captured as a different image with no associated colour. Often you will want to add colour to each channel (usually in the colour of the fluorophores emission) and to create composite images of 2 or more of the channels combined. This section will show you how to arrange and alter multi-channel images and change the colour of your images.\nWe will use the images NeuralTube.jpg plus NeuralTube Blue Saturated.tif and TrichromeIHC.tif throughout this section, along with the image set ‘RGB- blue.tif, RGB-green.tif and RGB-red.tif'.\nBit Depth \nThe bit depth of an image essentially determines the number of colours that can be displayed within that image. The number of colours (also referred to as dynamic range) can be calculated by the simple equation: 2^bit-depth.\nNote: in black and white images \"colours\" in the dynamic reange refer to shades of grey between white and black.\n\n\n\nBit Depth\nDynamic Range\n\n\n\n\n8-bit\n0 - 255 (or 256 colours)\n\n\n12-bit\n0 - 4,095 (or 4,096 colours)\n\n\n14-bit\n0 - 16,383 (or 16,384 colours)\n\n\n16-bit\n0 - 65,535 (or 65,536 colours)\n\n\n24-bit (also called 24-bit RGB = 3 x 8-bit channels)\n0 - 16,777,215 (or 16,777,216 colours)\n\n\n\nThe bit depth of an image will be determined by the camera that the image was captured on. Most images are captured on 8-bit, 12-bit, 14-bit or 16-bit cameras. Three colour fluorescent images are RGB 24-bit format (made up of 3 x 8-bit colour channels).\nIt is helpful to know the bit depth of the camera used to capture your images so you know the dynamic range of your colours.\n8-bit or RGB are the format most standard image viewers and presentation software will show. Images at other bit-depths may appear as black boxes. To allow any software to display your image correctly you can change the bit depth to 8-bit or 24-bit RGB very simply.\nSelect your image then navigate to Image -> Type and select 8-bit or RGB Color from the list.\n\nLikewise, some functions of FIJI will not work on an RGB 24-bit image (ie: thresholding). You can convert a single channel RGB image to 8-bit using the same steps as above, but selecting 8-bit from the choices. In a merged RGB image you can also create 3 x 8-bit images by splitting channels as shown below.\nNote: DO NOT alter bit and colour depth if you plan to do any analysis on the image, always work on a duplicate image and/or save the results of the conversion as a separate file to preserve your original image.\nSplit Channels \nTo separate the channels in a merged image go to Image -> Color -> Split Channels.\n\nThis will automatically detect and separate red, green and blue into individual monochrome images.\n\nThe channel will be identified for each image next to the image name.\n\nAssigning or Changing Image Colours Using LUTs \nMonochrome images have a grey look up table applied, meaning that each intensity is represented by a different shade of grey. In single channel images this can easily be changed to be different shades of red, green, blue etc. by simply changing the applied look up table (LUT).\nClick on the image you want to change and then go to Image -> LUTS and select the colour/LUT you want to apply to the image.\n\nYou can also find LUTs from the LUT icon in the tool bar.\n\nClick the icon to open the list of LUTs and select the one you want to apply to your image.\n\nTo apply a LUT to your image, ensure it is active by clicking in the image, then choose the colour you want to assigne from either the menu or tool bar. Here we have applied a red LUT to the red channel from our previously seperated image.\n\nMerge Channels \nIf you have individual images of channels that you want to merge, select Image -> Color -> Merge Channels.\n\nA window will open with different channel/colour options. It will attempt to automatically input the correct images into the different channel options. It should be accurate for images which have channels assigned (such as these).\n\nIf they are loaded incorrectly you can assign the individual images to the correct channel using the drop down menus beside each colour option. All open images will be displayed as an option. For empty channels/colours need required leave the image set as *None*.\n\nIf you want to keep the original single channel images open, check the box next to Keep source images.\nFor a simple merge, where you do not want to continue altering individual channels you can uncheck Create composite.\n\nHowever, if you want to make further alterations to channels within the merged image, keep this box selected to create a composite image. In the composite you can use the channels tool to make further changes to individual channels.\n\nOnce you have assigned your images to colours and set your options, click OK to create the merged image.\nChannels Tool \nA composite image will present as a stack with each channel represented by one slice of that stack. To make alterations to channels within a composite image you can use the Channels Tools. To open this tool, go to Image -> Color -> Channels Tool (or use shortcut Ctrl+Shift+Z).\n\nIn the Channels tool window you can select from the dropdown menu whether you want to work in composite mode, colour or greyscale.\n\nIn Composite mode – all images in the stack will appear to be a merged RGB image, however the active channel will be shown by the colour box surrounding the image.\n\nIn composite mode, checking and unchecking the boxes beside an channel will turn it on or off in all images. To make changes to a channel you must move the slider across to make that channel the active channel.\n\nIn Color – each channel will be displayed in the stack in the assigned colour. Only that channel will be visible when selected.\n\nIn Grayscale – each channel will be displayed as an individual image in the stack in grey. Only that channel will be visible when selected.\n\nIn colour and greyscale you can switch between channels by selecting the check boxes next to the channel or by moving the slider at the bottom of the image. To make changes to a channel you must select it using the check box or move the slider across to make that channel the active channel.\nYou can convert the composite to RGB at any time by selecting More -> Convert to RGB in the Channels tool window.\n\nYou can also convert to RGB via Image -> Color -> Stack to RGB.\n\nThis will create a new window containing a flat RGB image of whatever is displayed in the active slice. The composite will still be availble to make further changes. In this way the channels tool is useful for saving several variations of merged images (ie: different channel combinations).\n\nAssigning or Changing Image Colours in Composites \nAs well as creating different merged images, you can also use the Channels Tool to assign different colours to each channel in a composite image before converting to RGB.\nTo do this in composite mode, select the channel you wish to change using the slider at the bottom of the image. Then go to More and select your colour from the menu.\n\nYou can also do this in colour or greyscale mode by selecting the channel using the check box or slider and repeating these steps.\n\nColours can also be changed in composites by selecting the channel and changing the LUT using the same methods as described for monochrome images above (menu or LUT tool).\n\nYou can change all channels in the image in this way (for example chose magenta, yellow & cyan instead of red, green & blue) and then convert to a 24bit RGB image in the same way as above to create a single merged image in the new colours.\n\nAssigning Colours and Merging Images with More Than 8 Channels \nThere are only 8 colour options available when using the Merge Channels tool, so in order to create a merge of 8 or more colours a different method has to be used. To demonstrate this I have opened the three channel images _RGB-blue.tif, RGB-green.tif _and RGB-red.tif several times to give me 8 \"channels\".\nFirst, the images that you want to colour and merge need to be added into a stack. Open the images you want to merge then go to Images -> Stack -> Images to Stack.\n\nIn the resulting window make sure both boxes are ticked. You can give the stack a name, or just leave it as the default name - Stack.\n\nClick OK to create your image stack.\n\nNote: The images will be added into the stack in the order they were opened in FIJI.\nWe now need to define in FIJI that this is an 8 channel image. To do this we go to Images -> Hyperstack -> Stack to Hyperstack.\n\nIn the hyperstack window, ensure the number of channels, slices and frames is set correctly (in this example 8 channels, 1 slice, 1 frame). Choose Colour as the display mode. Then click OK.\n\nTo change the colour of any channels in the stack use the Channels Tool in colour mode, or scroll to the channel and apply a LUT from the menu or tool bar as previously described.\nNote: Channels tool can only display 7 channels, so to change channel 8 or higher you need to scroll to the image in the stack and apply the LUT.\n\nOnce you are happy with your colours, go to Image -> Colour -> Stack to RGB.\n\nThis will not create a flat merge as it cannot handle more than 7 colours. This step is still neccessary however to create the RGB images.\n\nTo change the RGB stack into a flat merge go to Image -> Stacks -> Z Project.\n\nIn the options, ensure all channels are included (1-8) and chose Sum Slices as the projection method. Click OK to create the flat merged image.\n\n\nInverting Images \nInverting an image will switch the colour and background, or “light and dark”, in the image. To invert, select the image and go to Edit -> Invert (or shortcut Ctrl+Shift+I).\n\nIn monochrome images, such as in the example below, inverting will switch the image to a white background with black signal.\n\nInverting the image is reversible until saved, but it is still best to start out working on a duplicate copy of the original image and save the inverted images as a copy, with a new file name.\nSaturation Indicator\nThe saturation indicator or HiLo LUT creates an image with some pixels in red and some pixels in blue. The red and blue pixels represent intensity values at the two extremes of the range. Red pixels are fully saturated (i.e. pure white) and blue pixels are fully under saturated (i.e. totally black). Both these types of pixels contain no measurable information as you cannot be sure how far above or below saturation they are.\nTo check the saturation levels, select your image and go to Image -> Lookup Tables -> HiLo.\n\nIn the demonstration image here (NeuralTube Blue Saturated.tif)we have adjusted the image deliberately to show a high level of over- and under-saturation, as shown by the red and blue in the resulting image.\n\nWorking with Colours in IHC Images \nImmunohistochemistry images do not have individual RGB channels like fluorescence images. You can still separate out the individual colours for basic area or counting measurements however, using the Colour Deconvolution tool. These separated ‘channels’ cannot be used for measurements like intensity as histology stains do not work in the same way as fluorescent channels.\nTo find the Colour Devoncolution tool go to Image -> Color -> Colour Deconvolution.\n\nIn the colour deconvolution window, there are a number of options in the drop down menu. The first option, From ROI, lets you specify the different stains in your image manually. The others are preconfigured to work with most standard histological stains. Select your stain (in this example we are using Masson Trichrome) and press OK.\n\nThis will separate the image into 3 ‘colours’ – in this case, each is representative of one dye used. For two colour stains such as H&E or Dab the two stains will be separated and a third image will display the mathematical leftovers from the equation used.\n\nYou can now use any of these ‘channel’ images for measurements like counts, or area. The methods for these are described in our FIJI Intermediate workshop.\nYou can also use these separated images to transform a histological stained image into a pseudo fluorescent image.\nFirst you will need to invert each of the individual images. Do this for each image by selecting the image and going to Edit -> Invert (or using shortcut Ctrl+Shift+I).\n\nYou can then assign LUTs to each image using the methods previously described. Here we have assigned LUTs in keeping with the 'red', 'green', and 'blue' colours of the Trichrome Dyes.\n\nWe then merge the channels as described for fluorescent images above to give you a pseudo-fluorescent version of the immunohistochemistry image.\n\nNote: changing your IHC to pseudo-fluroescence does not make intensity measuements possible. the values are still not equivalent to a true fluorescent marker.\n"},"part_6_image_adjustments.html":{"url":"part_6_image_adjustments.html","title":"PART 6: IMAGE ADJUSTMENTS","keywords":"","body":"PART 6: IMAGE ADJUSTMENTS \nIt is sometimes essential to adjust an image for publishing or to highlight an area of interest. Some adjustments need to be done carefully so as not to remove or add data from the original image. In this regard, it is usually safe to adjust linear parameters such as brightness and contrast (histogram levels) as long as under and over saturation is avoided. Adjusting non-linear parameters such as gamma and curves is strongly discouraged under all circumstances as it will change the relationship of the data in the image. All adjustments made to images prior to publication should be linear adjustments only, should be applied equally across the entire image and should be disclosed in the methods and/or figure legends.\nNote: In general it is recommended that you avoid performing any measurements on images which have been adjusted. Whenever possible analysis should be carried out on the untouched original data.\nIn this section we use the images RGB-Blue.tif, RGBstackProjected.tif and NeuralTube.jpg for demonstration purposes.\nBrightness and Contrast \nBrightness and Contrast are considered linear adjustments, provided they are applied equally across the entire image.\nTo adjust the brightness and contrast in an image, select the image and go to Image -> Adjust -> Brightness/Contrast (or use shortcut Crtl+Shift+C).\n\nThis will open a window with a histogram of the image data at the top with the range of intensities in the image shown. In this example the range is 0-255, as it is an 8bit image. The dynamic range for the intensities will vary depending on the image format and bit- depth of the camera used. Bit depth is discussed in more detail in Part 4 of these notes.\n\nYou can adjusting the brightness and contrast in several different ways. You can move the Minimum and Maximum or Brightness and Contrast sliders. These should only be adjusted to the limit of the data and not beyond it.\nThe Auto button will calculate and apply a histogram stretch automatically, but does not always make an appropriate adjustment.\nYou can also press the Set button and enter values directly.\n\nYou will be able to see adjustments as a preview in the image as you alter the levels. Once you are happy with your settings press the Apply button. Once the Apply button is pressed the original values in the image are altered to the new ones and the original data is lost. For this reason it is best to work on a duplicate image and save the result as a different file so as not to lose the original data.\nBelow we see the difference between the original image and an adjusted duplicate.\n\nGamma \nGamma is a non-linear adjustment as it alters the relationship between the dark and light pixels.\nGamma adjustments can be made to the image by selecting your image then going to Process -> Math -> Gamma.\n\nThis will open a gamma adjustment window with a slider to adjust the gamma value up or down.\nAdjust the slider as required, or input a value directly into the box. You can see adjustments in the image as you make them by checking the box next to Preview. When you are happy with the adjustments, click OK to apply the changes.\n\nYou will see from the images below that gamma adjustments have a significant impact on the image, and as these are a non-linear adjustment the relationship between dark and light is altered. It is recommended that gamma adjustments are avoided, and definitely not used on images that will be measured or published.\n\nColour Balance \nColour balance is more of a grey area. It is a linear adjustment (essentially equal to brightness and contrast) when applied to the entire channel image. However, it considered a non-linear adjustment in general as it alters the relationship between different components (channels) of the same image, ie: one is changed without the others being changed equally. Changing the brightness of only one channel is particularly problematic when comparing intensities or looking at co-localisation. Therefore it is recommended that Colour Balance changes be avoided.\nYou can adjust the levels of individual colours within an RGB image using the Color Balance tool. To find this go to Image -> Adjust -> Color Balance.\n\nIn the Colour Balance window you can select the channel from the drop down menu, then use the sliders to adjust the Minimum and Maximum as described above for a monochrome image.\n\nThis will essentially alter the brightness and contrast of the selected channel only and as such alters the relationship between channels. For this reason, any measurements based off intensity or the relationship between channels should not be performed following changes to colour balance.\nIn the example below you can see the difference between the original image on the left and the adjusted image on the right, which has the levels adjusted for the green channel only.\n\nImage Rotation \nYou can easily straighten an object in your image with the Image Rotation tool. Using this tool you can rotate to a defined angle, or completely flip the image. For images with specific structural arrangements it is advised that you use image flipping and rotation with caution, as complex structures may become distorted.\nTo flip or rotate your image, go to Image -> Transform and select your option.\n\nFlip Horizontally and Flip Vertically flip the image along the left hand side and top edges respectively.\n\nRotate 90 Degrees Right and Rotate 90 Degrees Left turn the images to the right or left.\n\nYou can also rotate an image to other angels of your choosing. To define the angle yourself, select the option Rotate from the options under the transform menu. This will open a new window where you can define the angle of rotation. Enter the angle in degrees in the first box.\n\nSelect None from the drop down Interpolation menu to minimise any changes to pixel information. Selecting Fill with Background Color will ensure any resulting blank space is coloured the same as the image background (usually black or white).\nNote: for images with high background levels, esultingin greyish background colouring the bkack background fill will be more noticable. The image can be cropped after rotation to remove te backfilled areas.\nTo preview the angle before completing the rotation select the check box next to Preview.\nOnce you are happy with your rotation angel click OK to apply it to the image.\n\nImage Translation \nYou can also shift the image within the frame using the Translate tool. This can also be found under the  Image -> Transform menu. \n\nThis will open a window where you can enter your offset values to shift the image in x and y. The values are entered in pixels.\nAgain select None under the Interpolation drop down menu to minimise pixel information changes. Check the box next to Preview to see the changes before applying to the image. \n\nWhen you are happy with the changes, click OK to apply.\n\nAgain any blank space created by moving the image will be filled with black, but hte image can be cropped to remove this if neccessary after translation is complete.\nNote: Always apply transform and translate movements to duplicates only and save as a copy. These tools should only be used for display purposes, never prior to analysis, and should always disclosed if used in published images. \n"},"part_7_working_with_stacks.html":{"url":"part_7_working_with_stacks.html","title":"PART 7: WORKING WITH STACKS","keywords":"","body":"PART 7: WORKING WITH STACKS \nImage stacks are composed of a number of related images opened on top of each other in a single window. Stacks can represent different channels from the same image, z-slices captured on the microscope or time series. When channel, Z-series or time information is recorded the images are usually opened as stacks automatically when bio-formats importer is used to open the files. You can also generate a stack yourself from related TIFF or JPEG images.\nThis section goes through the tools and methods for working with image stacks. More detailed informaiton on working with multiple dimmensions in imaging and stacks is covered in FIJI Intermediate.\nThe image NeuralTube.jpeg along with its individual channels and image stacks RGBStack.tif and MovieStack.tif will be used for demonstration throughout this section.\nNavigating Stacks \nYou can easily move through the slices in a stack using the bar at the bottom of the image.\n\nClick and drag the slider (1) to move through the stacks. You can also click on the left (2) and right (3) arrows to move the stack by 1 slice or click the play button (4) to run through the stack slices automatically.\nYou can monitor the slice number in the image information at the top left of the image window.\n\nCreating and Dismantling Stacks \nTo create a stack from multiple individual images go to Image -> Stacks -> Images to Stack.\n\nAn options window will open. You can give the stack a new name, or keep the generic ‘Stack’. To keep the original images select the box next to Keep Source Images.\n\nClick OK to generate the stack.\n\nTo reverse this and generate multiple single images from a stack go to Image -> Stacks -> Stack to Images.\n\nDuplicate Stack \nYou can use the Duplicate function for stacks also. Select your stack and follow the menu or shortcut to Duplicate as previously shown.\n\nWhen using Duplicate for a stack, only the current slice will be duplicated as a single image. This can be useful if you want to extract a slingle slice from your stack for display or analysis purposes.\nHowever, in the Duplicate window you will now have more options, where you select Duplicate Stack and can also nominate spceific slices to be duplicated intot he new stack. Use these options to duplicate multiple slices or the entire stack.\n\nWhen you are happy with your options, click OK to duplicate.\nAltering Stack Slices \nYou can alter the slices in a stack by adding, deleting or rearranging them.\nTo add or delete slices from a stack, navigate to the slice you want to modify and go to Image -> Stacks, and select the desired option.\n\nSelecting add slice will insert a new blank/black slice into the current stack position. Selecting delete slice will remove the current slice from the stack.\nYou can also add and delete multiple slices using the Slice Keeper or Slice Remover tools.\nSlice Keeper is found under Image -> Stacks -> Tools.\n\nSlice Keeper will ask you to nominate the slices you wish to keep in the stack, by number. You can also use Increment to keep every 2nd, 3rd, 4th, etc slice from the stack. Enter your numbers and select OK to generate the new stack.\n\nSlice Remover is found on he same menu as Slice Keeper.\n\nThe Slice Remover will prompt you to nominate the slices you wish to remove from the stack, by number. As with slice keeper, you can also use Increment to remove every 2nd, 3rd, 4th, etc slice from the stack. Enter your numbers and select OK to generate the new stack.\n\nSlice Keeper and Slice Remover are fairly interchagable and ultimately serve the same function.\nYou can also rearrange the order of slices in a stack using the Stack Sorter tool. Go to Image -> Stacks -> Tools -> Stack Sorter.\n\nYou can then move a slice forwards or backwards using the arrows (1) in the options box.\nYou can also select First (2) or Last (3) to move the current slice to the front or back of the stack.\nOther options include duplicating a slice (4) or inserting a new image into the stack from a file (5).\nAll of these commands will act on the current slice in the stack. Always scroll to the slice you want to change before selecting an option.\nYou can also select Reverse (6) to reverse the order of the entire stack.\n\nSplit and Concatenate Stacks \nYou can split a stack into smaller parts by selecting Image -> Stacks -> Tools -> Stack Splitter.\n\nEnter the number of smaller stacks you wish to split into and select OK.\n\nNote: The smaller stacks must be of equal size, so you need to enter a number divisible by the total number of slices. This allows the stack to split into multiple equal parts.\n\nTo combine multiple small stacks into one select Image -> Stacks -> Tools -> Concatenate.\n\nIn the resulting Concatenator window, you can check the box to include All open windows, or add and sort the desired stacks in the correct order using the drop down menus. You can give the new stack a name or keep the generic ‘Concatenated Stacks’ and check the box next to Keep original images if you wish to keep the smaller stacks open.\n\nThen select OK to generate the combined stack.\nMake Montage \nYou can use image stacks to generate side by side montages of channels, time points or z-sections. Select your stack then go to Image -> Stacks -> Make Montage.\n\nA window will open with a number of options for generating the montage, including the number of columns and rows that you want in the montage, scaling of the images, which slices of your stack you want to include, if you want to use increments and border width. You can also select the check box to label the montage with the slice titles.\nInput your required options and select OK to create the montage.\n\nIn the example below we have generated a montage of the individual channels plus the merged image using the settings shown in the options window above, but the same principles can be applied to create a montage of times or z-slices as well.\n\nMaximum Intensity Projections \nTo create a maximum intensity projection of a confocal z-stack, open your stack and go to Image -> Stacks -> Z-Project.\n\nIn the Z Projection window enter the first and last slice you want to project and the type of projection. For a maximun intesnity projection, select Maximum Intensity from the drop down window. Click on OK to create the projection.\n\nA new window will open with the projected, single plane image.\n\nThe new image will have the default name ‘MAX_imagename’. You can rename this when saving by using the Save As function.\n\n"},"acknowledgements.html":{"url":"acknowledgements.html","title":"Acknowledgements","keywords":"","body":"Acknowledgements \nThese workshop notes were prepared by Dr Sarah Creed of Monash Micro-Imaging at the Monash Health Translation Precinct.
