These workshop notes were prepared by Dr Sarah Creed of Monash Micro-Imaging at the Monash Health Translation Precinct. Preparation of these notes was made possible by generous contributions from Cameron Nowell, Monash Institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences, helpful discussion with Dr Kirstin Elgass and the contribution of demonstration images by researchers.
