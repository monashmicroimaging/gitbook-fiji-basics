# PART 1: INTRODUCTION TO FIJI {#part-1-introduction-to-fiji}

## FIJI {#fiji}

FIJI stands for **F**iji **I**s **J**ust **I**mageJ. FIJI and ImageJ are very similar and for most functions are interchangeable. Both are open source image analysis software packages, available to download for free. The main difference between FIJI and ImageJ is that FIJI comes pre-bundled with a number of useful plugins which would require separate download and installation in ImageJ. FIJI also has an auto-update function that ImageJ does not have. This workshop focuses specifically on FIJI, rather than ImageJ. As such, some things may differ if you are using ImageJ.

## Updates {#updates}

FIJI has a built in auto-update function which will run, as required, upon opening the program. To allow the updater to run, select **Yes, please** from the drop down menu and click **OK**. It is recommend that you always run the updater when it pops up. Extended periods without running the updater may result in FIJI no longer functioning correctly.

FIJI will then automatically search for updates to the program and pluguin packages.

Available updates will be displayed in a list. You can highlight specific updates you want to apply, but it is recommended that you apply all updates every time. To do this simply click **Apply Changes** at the bottom of the updater box, without selecting anything from the list.

FIJI will then run through the list and apply all updates.

Once the updates have been installed you will be asked to restart the program. Select **OK**, then close and restart FIJI.

You can also run a manual update in FIJI. Select **Help Update FIJI**. FIJI will then run through the same update steps as above. Again, you will need to restart FIJI once this process is completed.

Also under this **Help** menu, you can find a link to the **FIJI Wiki** page which has helpful information on FIJI functions and plugins, or go to https://imagej.net/Category:Tutorials.
